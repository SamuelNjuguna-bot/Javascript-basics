# String-Concatenation 
This is a way of combining two pieces of strings with an other data-type


1. __Using + Operator__
```
let name = "Pascal";
let conjuction = "is";
let object = "An old Language";

console.log(name + " "  + conjuction+ " " + object );
```

Output
```
Pascal is An Old Language

```
2. __Using the += Operator__


```
let name = "Pascal";
name += an old language;
console.log(name)

```

Output


```
Pascal is an Old Language

```

3. __Using Template Literals__
```
let profession = "teaching"

let verb = "Likes"

console.log(Samuel $(verb) $(profession))
```
Output


```
Samuel likes teaching

```
