A variable is like a container in javascript that can be used to store diffrent items there in.


1. __Declaring and initialising variables__


There are three ways of declaring variables in Java script by use of   let, var and const keywords.


This is giving the elements in the container names. Values can always be added later


```
const pi;
var name;
let x;


```





Initialising variables is like giving the name of the item in the container a value.



```
const mood = "happy"
var name = "Samuel";
let Age = 24 ;
```


2. __Updating Variables__



when using let and var keywords , the assigned values can always be changed later in the code.However this is forbiden when using the const keyword.
